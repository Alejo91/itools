itools 0.75 requires libsoup 2.28

For every issue below that cannot be solved with 2.28 we will open a
bug in bugs.hforge.org


Priority 1
==========

* Access log:

  - make the test-log.py into a unit test, or just include in somehow
    in itools/test

* Finish the event log.  Before libsoup we printed the request headers when
  there was an error.  With libsoup it looks like it is not obvious how to
  get this information.

Priority 2
==========

* Implement the TRACE method (in libsoup) see bug below for details.

  - http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590871

* Support "503 Service Unavailable".  When the server is too busy, it
  should automatically send the 503 response.

* Test & fix ikaaro behind two proxies: Apache -> Apache -> ikaaro


Priority 3
==========

* Support "301 Moved Permanently" XXX

* Request methods are case sensitive XXX
