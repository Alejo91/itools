0.8.0 (2005/04/18)

  URI
  - Correctly deal with empty references: "".

  Resources
  - Move to new style classes.
  - Add lock/unlock API. Implemented only by the Zope 2 resources for now.

  XML
  - New module "itools.xml.parser", is a wrapper around "expat" that
    provides a nicer programming interface.
  - New module "itools.xml.namespaces", provides the new improved namespace
    registry, a base class for namespace handlers, and some basic namespace
    handlers.
  - Now XML Documents have a root element, instead of a list of children.
    The XML declaration and the document type are stored in the instance
    variables 'xml_version', 'source_encoding', 'standalone' and
    'document_type'.
  - New API to work with attributes. Now the methods 'set_attribute',
    'get_attribute' and 'has_attribute' expect the namespace uri to be
    passed first, and the local name to be passed after. There is a new
    method, 'get_attribute_qname', that returns the qualified name (i.e.
    'dc:title') from the namespace uri.
    and the local name.
  - Now the node tree is lighter. The reference from a node to its parent
    has been removed. The 'NodeList' has been removed, now the children
    is just a list of nodes. The class "Raw" has been removed, now text
    nodes are unicode strings. Now attribute values are loaded as byte
    strings, for attributes not attached to an XML namespace.

0.6.4 (2005/02/16)

    while "#" is interpreted as "#" (instead of ""). This is more correct,
    but the game is not over yet (see "uri.py" for details).

  Handlers

0.6.0 (2005/01/07)

  Resources
  - Now "get_resources" is an iterator that returns a resource (not a name)
    at a time.
  - Memory folders provide "get_atime".

  Handlers
  - Add the methods "get_handler_names", "get_handlers" and "has_handler".
  - The methods "get_resource", "has_resource", "set_resource", etc. have
    been removed. Access them throug the "resource" attribute, or use the
    equivalent handler methods ("get_handler_names", etc).
  - Now text handlers only must define the method "to_unicode", which now
    accepts the optional parameter encoding.
  - The methods "__str__" and "__unicode__" have been removed. Use instead
    "to_str" and "to_unicode".
  - Serialization and de-serialization code has been moved from "xml.Schema"
    to "handlers.IO". Now the code serializes and de-serializes to and from
    byte strings.

  XML
  - The architecture has been cleaned and simplified, specially for attributes,
    whose API has changed.
  - The new method "traverse2" makes "walk" obsolete.

  Simple Template Language
  - The "stl:if" and "stl:attributes" expressions accept the new "not"
    operator. This change makes the "stl:ifnot" statement obsolete.

  - Now the catalog follows the load/save logic. As a side effect the index
    and unindex operation has been speeded up but a factor of 2, aproximately.

  Workflow
  - Remove the "__init__" method from the "WorkflowAware" class to avoid
    conflicts with handler classes. Now the method "enter_workflow" must
    be called explicitly.

  - Re-organize the handler chapters. Explain some things for the first time,
    explain other things better.
