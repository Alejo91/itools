itools 0.60.0 (2009/XX/XX)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.abnf             itools.i18n             itools.stl
  itools.core             itools.ical             itools.tmx
  itools.csv              itools.odf              itools.uri
  itools.datatypes        itools.pdf              itools.vfs
  itools.gettext          itools.pkg              itools.web
  itools.git              itools.relaxng          itools.workflow
  itools.handlers         itools.rest             itools.xapian
  itools.html             itools.rss              itools.xliff
  itools.http             itools.srx              itools.xml

Many of the changes in this release are to improve speed and scalability.
There has been also some code reorganization, and some packages have seen
major changes.

Indexing with itools.xapian is much faster now for two reasons.  First
extracting the text from some office formats (ODF and Excel) is a lot
faster.  Second, now we use the xapian tokenizer to split a text into
words (except for Chinese and Japanase texts).

The filesystem database (itools.handlers) has been improved and now
includes a read-only mode.  There is also a limit to the number of
file handlers that can be stored in the cache, hence reducing memory
usage.

Other optimizations include a 'parse_table' function about two times
faster than before; used for instance to parse iCal files.

The itools Virtual File System (itools.vfs) has been rewritten to use
gio (from the Glib [1]), while preserving backwards compatibility.

The web server (itools.web) now uses the Glib event loop.  Support for
HTTP/1.1 has been improved too (XXX).

The itools.isetup package has been renamed to itools.pkg, and so have
the related scripts (e.g. 'isetup-build.py' renamed to 'ipkg-build.py').
Two new packages, itools.python and itools.xmlfile, have been split
from itools.handlers and itools.xml, to avoid circular imports.

The implementation of RML [2] has been removed, now we promote PML [3]
instead.

Python 2.6 is required, and support for Python 2.5 has been drop.  Other
new dependencies include pygobject 2.16 [4] or later (used by itools.vfs
and itools.web), 'xlrd' [5] (used to index Excel files), 'poppler' [6] (PDF
files) and 'wv2' [7] (Word files).  See the README.txt file for the complete
table of required and recommended packages.

See the UPGRADE-0.60.0 file for further details on what has changed.
