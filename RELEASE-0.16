itools 0.16.1 (2007/07/05)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.tmx
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.uri
  itools.csv            itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.datatypes      itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.gettext        itools.rest             itools.workflow
  itools.handlers       itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.html           itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.http           itools.stl              itools.xml

This is a bug fix release:

 - We have removed a dependency, itools.catalog does not require anymore
   the command line tool "rsync".

 - The method "set_handler" (from itools.handlers) does the right thing
   now when the container is a virtual handler.

 - Now the method "stream_to_str" (from itools.xml) is able to handle
   CDATA sections.

 - In STL we have fixed the repeat stack: (repeat/x/index, repeat/x/start
   and repeat/x/end).

But most fixes (and small improvements) are in the itools.cms package:

 - An important bug has been fixed in the database, where the incorrect
   usage of "mkstemp" made sometimes a transaction to fail because all
   files descriptors were used.

 - Now we correctly unindex the content of a folder when it is removed.

 - A new method has been added to the API: "get_object".

 - Fixes and improvements for the Calendar object.

 - The script "icms-update" has been improved in different ways. One
   of the improvements is to help upgrading applications directly from
   0.14 to 0.16 (without going through 0.15).

 - The "icms-make-package -t quickstart" call has been fixed.

 - There are some little fixes and improvements for projects based on
   itools.cms, specifically in the "forgotten password" form, and for
   sending emails in some cases.

 - In the user interface look, we have given a more sensible default
   value for the indentation of "<ul>" elements.

itools 0.16.0 (2007/06/28)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.tmx
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.uri
  itools.csv            itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.datatypes      itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.gettext        itools.rest             itools.workflow
  itools.handlers       itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.html           itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.http           itools.stl              itools.xml

The main focus of this release has been quality:

 - The whole documentation has been updated and reviewed. Now we have a
   +200 pages PDF, and the code behaves as it is documented.

 - For the first time all unit tests are up-to-date. Check the README file
   to learn how to run them.

 - We have made a little round through the coding style, all modules are
   lowercase now.

 - The API has been flatten. This means that all functions, constants,
   classes and exceptions of a package are available at the package's root
   level (no need to go search a function in some module). Only exception
   is "itools.cms", which is too big to have a flat API.

But this release brings also some big new features.

The new top-level package "itools.rest" provides a partial implementation
of ReStructured Text [1].

Another new top-level package, "itools.odf", provides support for the
Open Document Format [2]. Specifically the scripts igettext-extract and
igettext-build are able to work with ODF files, so they can be used to
assist a translator to translate a ODF document.

The index & search engine (package "itools.catalog") has been re-worked.
With some new features (like the possibility to define custom fields),
and a much friendlier programming interface. Check the documentation.

The implementation of the XML file handler has been radically changed.
It does not use anymore an element-tree to represent the handler's state,
but a list of events: start tag, end tag, text node, etc. (this change
has been inspired by Genshi [3]).

Other packages have seen minor changes either to the programming interface or
to the user interface. Most notably: itools.uri, itools.vfs, itools.handlers,
itools.gettext, itools.csv, itools.ical and itools.cms.

Check the UPGRADE file for the details an how to update your code.
