The structure of a minimal iCMS application is:
    
  [1] __init__.py
  [2] locale/
        locale.pot
        en.po
  [3] root.py
  [4] setup.conf
  [5] setup.py
  [6] ui/


[1] The Python initialization file, "__init__.py", transforms a folder
into a Python package. It contains initialization code.

[2] The "locale" folder keeps the translations required to have a
mutlingual product. The file "locale.pot" is the template, it just
keeps the messages without any translation. The file "en.po" should
be empty, since english is most of the time the source language.

[3] The "root" module is where we will define the class for the
application's root. This way we take the control of iCMS, so we
can override its default behaviour. We want to do this most of
the time.

[4] The configuration file, "setup.conf", defines some variables
for use by "distutils", the Python's packaging system.

[5] The "setup.py" file is required by "distutils", but with itools
it should always be the same few lines, since we use the file "setup.conf"
instead.

[6] The folder "ui" will keep the product's skins. We need skins to publish
content to the web, like images and CSS files.
