Last time we worked with libsoup it was with the 2.26 stable release, and
with the 2.27 development branch.  Now the 2.28 stable version is already
available, and 2.29 is the new development branch.

itools 0.75 should require and support libsoup 2.28, though some issues
below may only be fixed with 2.30, or may stay open.


Priority 1
==========

* Implement graceful stop: the server stops listening for new connections
  but finishes to handle the connections already started (see the method
  'stop_gracefully')

  NOTE: this looks hard

* Verify again the OPTIONS method works with the latest stable release of
  libsoup (2.28)

  - http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590751

* Finish the access log, so we correctly log every request, whatever the
  result is (successful connection, connection broken by client, etc.)

  See discussion here:

  - http://mail.gnome.org/archives/libsoup-list/2009-August/msg00000.html

* Finish the event log.  Before libsoup we printed the request headers when
  there was an error.  With libsoup it looks like it is not obvious how to
  get this information.


Priority 2
==========

* Implement the TRACE method (in libsoup) see bug below for details.

  - http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590871

* Support "503 Service Unavailable".  When the server is too busy, it
  should automatically send the 503 response.


Priority 3
==========

* Support "301 Moved Permanently" XXX

* Request methods are case sensitive XXX
