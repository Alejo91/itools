itools 0.16.8 (2007/10/XX)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.tmx
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.uri
  itools.csv            itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.datatypes      itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.gettext        itools.rest             itools.workflow
  itools.handlers       itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.html           itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.http           itools.stl              itools.xml

The big news this release is that itools has been downgraded Python 2.4;
so now itools works with both Python 2.4 and 2.5.  (Why this? Because
Zope [1] does not yet work with Python 2.5, and we need to use itools
and Zope together from time to time).

Related to the above, for the first time we make a binary releases for
the Windows [2] platform.  There are two Windows installers, one for
Python 2.4 and the other for Python 2.5.

The CMS "Quick Start" [3] has been updated, and so has the itools related
code (the "icms-make-package" script).

And we have a new script, "isetup-quality.py", which makes some simple
statistics about Python source code.

There have been also some minor fixes and user interface improvements
to the CMS, including #128, #131, #133, #134, #135 and #136.
