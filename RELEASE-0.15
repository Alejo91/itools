itools 0.15.4 (2007/05/XX)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.csv            itools.pdf              itools.workflow
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xml
  itools.html           itools.tmx
  itools.http           itools.uri

This release brings two big new features:

 - The new top-level package "itools.pdf" provides a partial implementation
   of the Reportlab Markup Language [1].

 - The CMS (itools.cms) includes now an issue tracker.

Other than these two features, many bugs heve been fixed. The packages
concerned are: "itools.cms", "itools.xml", "itools.csv", "itools.http",
"itools.handlers" and "itools.stl".

itools 0.15.3 (2007/04/06)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

This release brings some fixes and a few programing and user interface
improvements. The list of the most important changes, classified by
package, follows.

[itools.vfs] The new method "traverse" is a generator that traverses a
  folder and returns the path of every file and folder within it.

[itools.csv] Now it is possible to define a column as an internal key that
  uniquely identifies a row within the CSV file. See the type "IntegerKey"
  and the method "get_key".

[itools.ical] The search API has been reduced to methods "search_events",
  "search_events_in_date" and "search_events_in_range" (besides the more
  low-level method "search").

[itools.cms] The registration process and the user management interfaces
  have been improved. WebSite objects have gained the role "admins" (now
  we have four access levels: guest, member, reviewer and admin).

  The method "has_property" has been added to all CMS objects (it is a
  short way to call the metadata's "has_property").

itools 0.15.2 (2007/03/22)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

This release brings tons of changes, many more than it is reasonable
to do for just a minor version bump.

Highlights:

 - The speed of the iCalendar handler has been radically improved,
   specifically for searches. We have added reverse indexes and now
   the method "search" offers the same API as the CSV handler.

 - A new module, "itools.i18n.locale", has been added to provide support
   for locale information like dates.

 - The database system for "itools.cms" has been re-worked. The code
   is cleaner, faster and more robust.

 - There have been major user interface improvements in "itools.cms".
   Most notably, a drop-down menu has replaced the tabs. There is also
   a new menu in the left column called "Main Menu", with links to the
   most frequently used views.

   Other improvements involve the folder's browse view (sort by size,
   localized last modification time), and the JavaScript calendar
   widget, which is multilingual now.

 - The Wiki and Calendar objects of "itools.cms" have been improved.
   The first has a new "export to PDF" feature and has a generally
   better user interface. The second has an improved weekly view.

 - A new object has been added to "itools.cms": Web-Site. Its intended
   purpose is to be the root of a public (extranet) or private (intranet)
   site; so a single "itools.cms" instance may host several web sites,
   with a shared user database.

 - The user management and control access interfaces of "itools.cms" have
   been re-worked. And now we have two security policies: intranet or
   extranet.

   Also, now users have the fields "firstname" and "lastname" (instead of
   just one field for the fullname).

 - The API of "itools.cms" has been tweaked to make easier several tasks,
   most notably to define custom skins, to use the "table" widget, and
   to validate forms.

 - Hervé Cauwelier worked on "itools.cms" (Wiki, CSS), got the API of
   "itools.web" working as documented, and fixed bugs;
 - Nicolas Deram worked on "itools.ical", "itools.cms.ical", and fixed
   bugs;
 - J. David Ibáñez worked on the user interface of "itools.cms" and
   the related programming interface, on the performance of "itools.ical"
   and fixed bugs.

itools 0.15.1 (2007/01/15)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

This release brings some new features to itools.cms, and a lot of aesthetic
and usability improvements:

  - Two new object types have been added, a forum and a wiki;
  - Added a contact form;
  - Added a forgotten password form;
  - Changed the layout of the menus;
  - Updated colors, icons and views here and there.

Other than this the focus of 0.15.1 has been to clean the code. Specially
the support for dates and times, and the programming interface of
configuration handlers, has been improved.


Credits:

 - Hervé Cauwelier contributed the Forum and Wiki objects, and worked to
   improve the user's experience;
 - J. David Ibáñez added the contact and forgotten password forms, and
   worked on the user interface and cleaning the source code;
 - Sylvain Taverne fixed the Dublin Core schema.

itools 0.15.0 (2006/12/20)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

The template language STL has seen the most important change since its
inception. A new method for variable substitution has been implemented,
it replaces "stl:attributes" and "stl:content". To illustrate this change,
while before we wrote:

  <a stl:attributes="href object_uri" stl:content="object_title" />

Now we will write:

  <a href="${object_uri}">${object_title}</a>
  
This new approach produces more compact and readable templates. It will
also make easier to build some user interfaces. And will help translators
since the messages extracted from the templates will be more easy to read.


This release is also the first to include some C code. We have rewritten
the XML parser ("itools.xml.parser") in C for performance. The programming
interface is mostly the same (see the UGRADE.txt file for the incompatible
changes).

For those who wonder... Why yet-another-xml-parser? Because its programming
interface is much much simpler (that means better) than the parsers based
in back-calls. See the itools documentation to know more [1].


The other big changes in this release are in "itools.cms", one is for
disk usage, the other is functional.

The code that implements transactions has been rewritten. From a brute
force technique we have moved to a refined one that takes advantage of
the extensibility of the "itools.vfs" layer. The visibile change is that
we don't need anymore a backup database, so the size of an instance has
been reduced to (almost) the half.

The functional change has to do with user management. Now we use the
email address to identify users, instead of a username. The user must
confirm the registration sending an email, this way the application
can be certain the email address is valid.


There have been also some smaller improvements to the programming
interface of other packages, most notably "itools.vfs", "itools.catalog",
"itools.web" and "itools.cms". See the file UPGRADE.txt file for the
incompatible changes.
