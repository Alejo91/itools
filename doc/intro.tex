\chapter{Introduction}

This paper is the official documentation of {\tt itools}.

\section{What is {\tt itools}?}

{\tt itools} is a Python\footnote{\tt http://www.python.org} package.
Originally it was intended to develop web applications, but being low
level stuff it is likely to be found useful in other contexts.

It consists of a collection of sub-packages and modules which makes up a
coherent set of tools for the developer. A summary of these tools follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item {\tt itools.uri} -- an API to manage URIs, to identify and locate
    resources.

 \item {\tt itools.resources} -- an abstraction layer over resources that
   lets to manage them with a consistent API, independently of where they
   are stored.

 \item {\tt itools.handlers} -- resource handlers infrastructure (resource
   handlers are non persistent classes that add specific semantics to
   resources). This package also includes several handlers {\em out of the
   box}.

 \item {\tt itools.xml} -- XML infrastructure, includes resource handlers
   for XML, XHTML and HTML documents. Plus the {\bf S}imple {\bf T}emplate
   {\bf L}anguage.

 \item {\tt itools.i18n} -- tools for language negotiation and text
   segmentation.

 \item {\tt itools.workflow} -- represent workflows as automatons, objects
   can move from one state to another through transitions, classes can add
   specific semantics to states and transitions.

 \item {\tt itools.lucene} -- An underway implementation of the famous
   Jakarta's indexing and search tool:
   {\em Lucene}\footnote{\tt http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene}.
\end{itemize}



\section{Project status}

Currently {\tt itools} is in alpha stage of development (at the time of
this writing the last version available is {\bf 0.4}). This means that the
API is unstable, the documentation is incomplete, and there are many bugs.
You are warned.

\section{About this document}

The development keeps ahead of the documentation. Today only four aspects
of {\tt itools} are documented. By order of appearence:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The first chapter is dedicated to {\tt itools.uri}: we will learn how
    to manipulate {\bf U}niform {\bf R}esource {\bf I}dentifiers.

  \item Follows {\tt itools.resources}, the file like abstraction layer.

  \item In third place comes {\tt itools.handlers}, or the art of working
    with resources.

  \item Closing is the {\bf S}imple {\bf T}emplate {\bf L}anguage, as unknown
    by the Python community as it is simple, powerful and fast.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Background}

Remember that this is a Python package, if you don't know about the Python
programming language better go read the tutorial first:

\begin{quote}
  {\tt http://www.python.org/.../html/tut/tut.html}.
\end{quote}

Through this document different technologies will be exposed. Proper
references will be given.

\section{Get ready}

Before going further, be sure your system is correctly setup. The {\tt itools}
package requires Python 2.3 or later.

Download the last version from {\tt http://sf.net/projects/lleu}, then
unpack it somewhere. The {\tt itools} software is a Python package, so
it uses {\em distutils}, to install it just type:

\begin{code}
    $ python setup.py install
\end{code}

Be sure to have the right permissions.
