itools 0.14.3 (2006/09/22)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

This is mostly a bug-fix release:

 - A new datatype for time objects has been added to itools.datatypes
   (#104).

 - Now there is some support for the HTTP layer in itools.vfs, the methods
   "exists", "get_mimetype", "get_mtime", "is_file" and "is_folder" and
   "open" work.

 - An important bug in itools.catalog has been fixed, now indexing of
   stored fields when the value is a list of byte strings works fine.

 - Now the method "context.come_back" (from itools.web) accepts a URI
   object for the "goto" parameter, not just a string.

 - There have been many improvements to the calendar code, both in
   itools.ical and itools.cms: #82, #246, #496, #507 and #509.

 - Fix renaming of a non-empty folder. The external editor (itools.cms)
   works again. Text handlers have a view to change their workflow state.
   Some templates (e.g. image preview) are not broken anymore in other
   languages than english (#502, #511). And anonymous users can reach the
   profile page.

Credits:

 - Hervé Cauwelier helped with the calendar code;
 - Nicolas Deram kept working on the calendar and calendar related code;
 - J. David Ibáñez fixed bugs here and there.

itools 0.14.2
=============

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

This release brings user interface improvements and many bug fixes. These
are the most important changes:

  itools.catalog -- Fix keyword fields that are indexed but not stored,
    when there is at least one value that contains spaces. The format of
    the catalog changes a little so it must be rebuilt.

  itools.cms -- The HTML/CSS code for the tabs has been updated to work
    better in different browsers, now it even looks nice in text mode
    (#382). The web interface for calendar objects has seen various
    improvements (#82, #496).

    The configuration file and the "icms-init" script accept a new option,
    "smtp-host", which defines the host to use to send emails.

    A bunch of minor bugs have been fixed in itools.cms, including #306,
    #308, #458, #459, #460, #497, #498, #500 and #501.

  itools.csv -- The CSV parser has been separated from the CSV handler, so
    it can be used independently ("from itools.csv import parser"). Fixed
    a serious bug which prevented to create CSV handlers from scratch.

  itools.gettext -- Now the PO handler properly detects the charset defined
    in the PO files header. The family of igettext scripts has been updated
    to use the new API of itools 0.14.

  itools.xhtml -- Now the "title" attribute of (X)HTML documents is always
    extracted to be translated, not only in "img" elements. Fix corner case
    in the automatic translation code. Declare some elements as inline to
    improve the behaviour of the translation machinery.

Credits:

 - Hervé Cauwelier improved the web interface of itools.cms;
 - Nicolas Deram updated the calendar code;
 - J. David Ibáñez fixed many bugs;
 - Josef Meile found the problem in the PO handler.

itools 0.14.1
=============

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

In spite of being a minor release, there are some important and visible
(and backwards compatible) changes.

First and foremost, the functional scope of itools.cms has been extended
with calendar objects. It is possible to create a new empty calendar or
upload ics files.

Very important too is that now the web server is gracefully stopped.
This means the pending requests will be processed before shutting down
the server.

Also, the French translation has been updated.

And of course there are a bunch of bug fixes, accross the uri, handlers,
csv, web and cms packages. This includes the task tracker items: #98,
#416, #455, #456 and #457.

Credits:

 - Hervé Cauwelier updated the French translation and fixed many bugs;
 - Nicolas Deram implemented the calendar objects in itools.cms;
 - J. David Ibáñez implemented the graceful stop and fixed many bugs.

itools 0.14.0 (alias Bolívar)
==============================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

We have choosen to name this release Bolívar, it is our little homage
to Simón Bolívar "El Libertador" [1] in the 223th anniversary of his
birthday (July 24, 1783).

This release, itools 0.14.0, brings important API and performance
improvements accross several sub-packages.

The most notably change is the new "itools.vfs" package (where "vfs"
stands for Virtual File System). It replaces the "itools.resources"
package. While functionally equivalent, "itools.vfs" offers a much
more intuitive and rich API.

Our index and search engine, the "itools.catalog" package, sports
a more compact file format. And performance for indexing, unindexing
and searching has been improved by about a 2x factor.

The API and performance of other packages has been greatly improved,
specially for "itools.handlers" and "itools.web". Also, the user
interface of "itools.cms" has been simplified, most important the
access control screens.

Last, we have raised the bar a little, since itools 0.14.0 the minimum
required version of Python is 2.5.

See the UPGRADE.txt file for more details.

itools 0.13
===========

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.csv            itools.resources        itools.workflow
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xml
  itools.html           itools.tmx


The most relevant news in this release are...

The "itools.cms" package does not depends on the ZODB anymore, now it
stores the information directly in the filesystem, as files and folders.
This enables us to use all the tools we like and love for introspection
and manipulation of the database (grep, vi, etc.). It also means a
boost to the application's performance.

The Command Line Interface has been updated to use our new conventions.
The script "icms.py" has been split into: icms-init, icms-start,
icms-stop, icms-update and icms-restore; "igettext.py" has been split
into: igettext-extract, igettext-merge and igettext-build; and so on.
The consequences basically are shell completion for free, and a better
online documentation.

The packaging has also seen deep changes. Unit tests are all centralized
into the "test" directory. The new family of "isetup" scripts
(isetup-update-locale, isetup-build and isetup-test) will simplify the
localization, build and test processes, hence helping us to deliver a
better product.

While only visible to us developers of itools, the switch from GNU arch
to GIT [1] to manage the source code, will streamline the development
process, reduce the entry barrier to new contributors, and in the end
help us to get out a better product.

Last, but probably most important, we have changed the licensing of itools
from LGPL to GPL. While this change may not be for the taste of many Python
developers, we believe that itools belongs to the group of libraries that
"make a difference", hence it is better served by the GPL license [2].

For a more detailed list of the changes see the CHANGES.txt file.

itools 0.12
===========

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.web
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.workflow
  itools.csv            itools.resources        itools.xhtml
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.xliff
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xml
  itools.handlers       itools.tmx
  itools.html           itools.uri


The twelfth release defines an inflection point in the development of itools,
to celebrate it we start writing "release notes" for the first time.

The ikaaro CMS (Content Management System), that before was distributed as
a separate Zope package, has now been included in itools as "itools.cms".
And it does not requires Zope anymore (note that the ZODB and PIL packages
are still needed).

The new script "icms.py" makes it easier than ever to deploy and manage
an ikaaro instance. Type "icms.py --help" for an start.

On other news, Hervé Cauwelier has been working hard to deploy a new sexy
skin for ikaaro. Codenamed Aruni, the new skin, alongside of major
improvements to the user interface, makes of this release an important
milestone in the road for prime-time use.

A demo is online for a taste, http://demo.ikaaro.org (login as admin/admin).

And last but not least, the new top package "itools.csv" implements a higher
level API to work with CSV files. Brought to you by Piotr Macuk.
