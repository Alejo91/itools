Comments on the problems faced to pass from latex to reST:


1. A section can't be followed by a subsubsection. The following is valid
   Latex code:

   \section{Introduction}
   \subsubsection{About XML}

   But reST says: "Title level inconsistent"


2. It is not possible to highlight letters in a word:

   {\bf U}niform {\bf R}esource {\bf I}dentifiers


3. With \setcounter and \secnumdepth Latex allows to control which levels
are numbered and which levels are shown in the table of contents.


4. \begin{quote}\begin{verbatim} ... \end{verbatim}\end{quote} is replaced
by ::, but this construct does not indent the block.
