\chapter{eXtensible Markup Language}

The purpose of this chapter is to explain the XML services provided by
{\tt itools}, which can be found in the sub-package {\tt itools.uri}.

\section{XML.Document}

As the reader already knows the XML services are built upon the resources
and handlers infrastructure. Hence the first thing we are going to talk
about is the {\tt XML.Document} class, a handler class:

\begin{code}
    >>> from itools.xml import XML
\end{code}
