itools 0.14.0 (alias Bolívar)
==============================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

We have choosen to name this release Bolívar, it is our little homage
to Simón Bolívar "El Libertador" [1] in the 223th anniversary of his
birthday (July 24, 1783).

This release, itools 0.14.0, brings important API and performance
improvements accross several sub-packages.

The most notably change is the new "itools.vfs" package (where "vfs"
stands for Virtual File System). It replaces the "itools.resources"
package. While functionally equivalent, "itools.vfs" offers a much
more intuitive and rich API.

Our index and search engine, the "itools.catalog" package, sports
a more compact file format. And performance for indexing, unindexing
and searching has been improved by about a 2x factor.

The API and performance of other packages has been greatly improved,
specially for "itools.handlers" and "itools.web". Also, the user
interface of "itools.cms" has been simplified, most important the
access control screens.

Last, we have raised the bar a little, since itools 0.14.0 the minimum
required version of Python is 2.5.

See the UPGRADE.txt file for more details.

itools 0.13
===========

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.csv            itools.resources        itools.workflow
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xml
  itools.html           itools.tmx


The most relevant news in this release are...

The "itools.cms" package does not depends on the ZODB anymore, now it
stores the information directly in the filesystem, as files and folders.
This enables us to use all the tools we like and love for introspection
and manipulation of the database (grep, vi, etc.). It also means a
boost to the application's performance.

The Command Line Interface has been updated to use our new conventions.
The script "icms.py" has been split into: icms-init, icms-start,
icms-stop, icms-update and icms-restore; "igettext.py" has been split
into: igettext-extract, igettext-merge and igettext-build; and so on.
The consequences basically are shell completion for free, and a better
online documentation.

The packaging has also seen deep changes. Unit tests are all centralized
into the "test" directory. The new family of "isetup" scripts
(isetup-update-locale, isetup-build and isetup-test) will simplify the
localization, build and test processes, hence helping us to deliver a
better product.

While only visible to us developers of itools, the switch from GNU arch
to GIT [1] to manage the source code, will streamline the development
process, reduce the entry barrier to new contributors, and in the end
help us to get out a better product.

Last, but probably most important, we have changed the licensing of itools
from LGPL to GPL. While this change may not be for the taste of many Python
developers, we believe that itools belongs to the group of libraries that
"make a difference", hence it is better served by the GPL license [2].

itools 0.12
===========

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.web
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.workflow
  itools.csv            itools.resources        itools.xhtml
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.xliff
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xml
  itools.handlers       itools.tmx
  itools.html           itools.uri


The twelfth release defines an inflection point in the development of itools,
to celebrate it we start writing "release notes" for the first time.

The ikaaro CMS (Content Management System), that before was distributed as
a separate Zope package, has now been included in itools as "itools.cms".
And it does not requires Zope anymore (note that the ZODB and PIL packages
are still needed).

The new script "icms.py" makes it easier than ever to deploy and manage
an ikaaro instance. Type "icms.py --help" for an start.

On other news, Hervé Cauwelier has been working hard to deploy a new sexy
skin for ikaaro. Codenamed Aruni, the new skin, alongside of major
improvements to the user interface, makes of this release an important
milestone in the road for prime-time use.

A demo is online for a taste, http://demo.ikaaro.org (login as admin/admin).

And last but not least, the new top package "itools.csv" implements a higher
level API to work with CSV files. Brought to you by Piotr Macuk.
