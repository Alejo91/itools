itools 0.50.0 (2008/XX/XX)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.abnf             itools.ical             itools.tmx
  itools.csv              itools.isetup           itools.uri
  itools.datatypes        itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.gettext          itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.git              itools.relaxng          itools.workflow
  itools.handlers         itools.rest             itools.xapian
  itools.html             itools.rss              itools.xliff
  itools.http             itools.srx              itools.xml
  itools.i18n             itools.stl

The "itools.catalog" package, which provided an index&search engine, has
been replaced by "itools.xapian".  The new package is a wrapper around
the Xapian [1] engine; it provides the same API of "itools.catalog",
only the speed is different.

The new package "itools.isetup" provides the infrastructure required by
the new "isetup-cache-list.py", "isetup-info.py", "isetup-install.py"
and "isetup-release.py" scripts.  Together they make up a toolset to
manage the Python packages installed in a Python environment.

Other new packages are "itools.srx", with a partial implementation of
the "Segmentation Rules eXchange" format [2].  And "itools.relaxng",
with a partial implementation of "Relax NG" [3].

The itools.pdf package includes the new PDF Markup Language (PML), which
renders the itools implementation of RML [4] obsolete.

The XML parser has been rewritten to provide a more complete and
accurate support of the standard.  There have been also significant
changes to the API, specially to the definition and handling of XML
namespaces.

The "itools.web" package has seen major architecture and API changes.
The ODF support has been substantially improved, in particular through
the use of RelaxNG.  The support of multilinugual formats like PO and
XLIFF has been improved with new features like placeables and context
handling.

Almost every other package has seen API or implementation modifications
to different degrees.  Check the upgrade notes and documentation for
further details.

Now Python 2.5.2 version or later is required, Python 2.6 is supported.
