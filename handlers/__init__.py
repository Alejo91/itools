"""
This package provides an abstraction layer for files and directories.
There are two key concepts, resources and handlers.

A resource is anything that behaves like a file (it contains an array of
bytes), as a directory (it contains other resources) or as a link (it
contains a path or an uri to another resource). Doesn't matters wether
a resource lives in the local file system, in a database or is a remote
object accessed with an URI.

A resource handler adds specific semantics to different resources, for
example there is a handler to manage XML files, another to manage PO
files, etc...
